A multi-agent system consists of multiple agents (LLMs autonomously using tools in a loop) working together. Our Research feature involves an agent that plans a research process based on user queries, and then uses tools to create parallel agents that search for information simultaneously. Systems with multiple agents introduce new [...] agents with separate context windows to add more capacity for parallel reasoning. The latest Claude models act as large efficiency multipliers on token use, as upgrading to Claude Sonnet 4 is a larger performance gain than doubling the token budget on Claude Sonnet 3.7.

    "summary": "정보의 범위와 실시간성은 확보했지만 여전히 어떤 질문에 어떤 도구를 써야 할까?라는 과제가 남았습니다. 변화가 적고 정적인 정책 문서는 벡터 스토어 검색이 적합하고, Jira 티켓이나 신규 프로젝트 상황은 시시각각 바뀌는 데이터이므로 MCP 서버 접근이 필요했습니다. 이 판단을 매번 사람이 설계할 수는 없었기에 우리는 ReAct구조를 도입했습니다. 예를 들어 \"복지 정책 담당자가 누구야\"라는 질문이 들어오면, 다음과 같은 과정을 거칩니다. 1. 추론: 담당자 정보가 필요하다고 판단합니다. 2. 행동: 벡터 스토어에서 조직도를 검색하고, MCP 서버로 최신 담당자 정보를 확인합니다. 3. 관찰: 담당자 이름, 연락처, 소속팀 정보를 종합해서 답변합니다. 4. 반복: 추론–행동–관찰 단계를 결과가 충분해질 때까지 반복 과정을 순환합니다. [...] ### (3) 실시간 정보, MCP 서버로 연결하다 지식을 선별해 저장하는 전략은 효율적이었지만 한계가 있었습니다. 저장 대상이 아니거나 저장 주기 외의 최신 데이터는 반영되지 않아 오늘 새로 등록된 Jira 티켓이나 방금 올라온 Wiki 문서와 같은 실시간 정보는 찾을 수 없었습니다. 이를 해결하기 위해 MCP(Model Context Protocol) 서버를 활용했습니다. MCP는 LLM과 외부 시스템을 표준화된 방식으로 연결하는 프로토콜로, 서로 다른 도구와 서비스를 일관된 인터페이스로 통합할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다. Atlassian MCP 서버로 Confluence Wiki·Jira의 최신 정보와 저장하지 않았던 데이터까지 실시간으로 가져올 수 있게 되었습니...",
